Final project for The Odin Project Foundations Course

I didn't do much CSS for this, since I've worked a lot on CSS on other projects. Therefore this is not as pretty as I could make it.
I went back to The Odin Project after second semester of NTV, where we learned React, so I could learn vanilla JavaScript in-depth.
